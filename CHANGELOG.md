- Update to Bot API 4.1.

# 0.14.0

- Make integration & controller specs consistent.

    - Changed signature `dispatch(bot, update) => dispatch(update, bot)`.
    - `update` helper is symbolized by default.
    - `build_update(type, data)` is dropped in favor of `deep_stringify(type => data)`.

      `telegram/bot/rspec/integration/rails`.
    - `:telegram_bot` rspec tag is replaced with `telegram_bot: :rails`.
- __Breaking change__. Use bang-methods as actions for commands.
  This prevents calling context contextual actions and payload specific actions with commands.
  Translation helper strips `!` from action name for lazy translations.
- __Breaking change__. Drop `.context_handler`, `.context_to_action!` methods.

  It's the same as `.context_to_action!` is enabled by default.
